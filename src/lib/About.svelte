  <h4>Welcome!</h4>
  <p>
    When we moved to <a href="https://www.sherwoodoregon.gov/">Sherwood</a>, we
    struggled with signing our kids up for sports. The city provides links to
    some
    <a
      href="https://www.sherwoodoregon.gov/community/page/sherwood-youth-sports">
      Sherwood-based organizations</a
    >, but learning the details about what was available and when to sign up is
    a chore. Information is spread across many websites, and often the best
    information is via word-of-mouth, or by being in a certain Facebook group.
    And some sports are only available in other nearby towns.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of <span class="fw-bold fs-6">Sherwood Sports</span> is to make this
    a bit easier by pulling key information about sports programs into one convenient
    dashboard. Find what you're looking for quickly, and know when to sign up.
  </p>
  <h4 class="mt-4">Using the Dashboard</h4>
  Each entry in the dashboard provides some or all of:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Links to the organization's homepage, and possibly links to individual
      programs if available.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dates when the season runs, or "Year round". If a row <span
        class="bg-success bg-opacity-25">
        &nbsp;is highlighted green
      </span>, it means that the season starts within 2 months so you may want
      to look into registering.
    </li>
    <li>
      Age ranges, either in years <span
        class={`badge rounded-pill text-bg-primary`}>6-10</span>
      or grades <span class={`badge rounded-pill text-bg-info`}>3rdâ€“12th</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the organization is <strong>not</strong> based in Sherwood, the location
      will be shown.
    </li>
  </ul>

  A <QuestionCircle /> means I don't have that information. If you can help fill
  in those gaps, <a href="#contribute">please let me know</a>.

  <h4 class="mt-4">What sports/clubs are included?</h4>
  <p>
    The site track sports programs based primarily Sherwood, but also includes
    some nearby groups if they fill a gap. For example, Tualatin's MVP Sports
    offers flag football through 8th grade, whereas Sherwood's club stops at
    4th. Any age ranges are included, so adult program are fine too.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following are specifically <strong>not</strong> included at this time:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-sport clubs and activities</li>
    <li>School and YMCA programs (consult their catalogs directly)</li>
    <li>Individual trainers</li>
  </ul>
